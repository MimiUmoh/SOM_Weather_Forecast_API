### How to use it 
1. To use the weather application, you need to get a weather API key for both the current weather and the fiveday or three hour weather forecasts. You can create your own account and get you own api key.  You can use these links to help you https://openweathermap.org/current) , https://openweathermap.org/forecast5 .
2. Once you have sorted that out you can then use your API. You can then pick a city ID and city (name) to test.
3. to Create methods for your test you go to the services folder in the lib file. You can create methods for both your five day or three hour forecast and current forecast there.
4. You write tests within the spec folder
5. Once you have done all of this, you can run ‘rspec’ on your terminal on the text editor to see your results. You will then be told whether or not there were any failures in your test.
